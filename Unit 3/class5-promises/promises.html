  // Promise

  //1. Fullfilled (success)
  //2. rejected (failure)
  //3. In process (pending)

  //How does this thing applies to coding?

  //Uploading something example
  //1.I will try to upload your image (creation of the promise - new promise() )
  //2.while doing it it shows you the progress of upload ()
  //3.if image successfully uploaded, ( fullfilled, resolve ())
  //3.1 - it will show the image ()
  //3.2 - it will show notification image upload successfully ( )

  // How do it know if my image is successfully uploaded? ( .then  and .catch, async await )
